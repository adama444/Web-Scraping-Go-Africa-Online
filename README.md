# Web-Scraping-Go-Africa-Online

The project is made using visual studio code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) on arch-linux distribution.
Configure your vscode environment by installing:

- scalameta.metals
- scala-lang.scala

Also I recommend to install the build tool : `sbt`.

After that you can run the project from vscode or from the build tool sbt by entering in sbt shell : `$ sbt`.

When you get the sbt prompt, execute `compile` and `run`.
